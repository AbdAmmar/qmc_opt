This repository contains code designed to optimize the orbitals and Jastrow parameters for a Slater-Jastrow wavefunction. 
Leveraging the powerful capabilities of the [QP2](https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2) and [QMCCHEM2](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmcchem2) codes, 
this software streamlines the optimization process for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
